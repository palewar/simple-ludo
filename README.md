Ludo is a Board game - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game)

Demo - https://palewar.github.io/simple-ludo/

Current Status:

Board Design Complete. It's not a complete board game which can be played. Only contains the game board design. 
No images are used. Complete design is done using HTML & CSS

CSS Concepts Used:

CSS Grid - For General Layout\
Conic Gradient - For 4 trianles in center sq\
Radial Gradient - For 4 Circles in Corner Squares

CSS can be improved a lot. Any inputs and suggestions are most welcome. 

I plan to program the game play in Javascript now.
